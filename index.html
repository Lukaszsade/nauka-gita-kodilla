<h1>Pink Floyd</h1>
<h3>Another brick in the wall</h3>
<p>We don't need no education<br>
    We don't need no thought control<br>
    No dark sarcasm in the classroom<br>
    Teachers leave them kids alone<br>
    Hey! Teacher, leave them kids alone!<br>
    All in all it's just another brick in the wall<br>
    All in all you're just another brick in the wall<br>
